# Terraform AWS Remote State s3 Backend

This Terraform module can be used to set up remote state management 
using S3 backend form your account. It will create the S3 bucket with
encryption enabled via KMS and create a DynamoDB table for state locking.
It will also create an IAM policy to allow Terraform to use this service.

## Usage
This module outputs terraform_iam_policy which can be attached to IAM users,
groups or roles running Terraform. This will allow the entity accessing 
remote state files and the locking table.

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}

module "remote_state" {
  source = "github.com/grumpygrower/terraform-aws-s3-backend.git"
  providers = {
    aws = aws
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "terraform" {
  name = "TerraformUser"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy_attachment" "remote_state_access" {
  user = aws_iam_user.terraform.name
  policy_arn = module.remote_state.terraform_iam_policy.arn
}
```

Once the resources are created, you can configure your terraform environment
to use the S3 backend as follows.

```
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        bucket = state_bucket.bucket
        key = "path/terraform.tfstate"
        region "eu-west-2"
        encrypt = true
        kms_key_id = kms_key.id
    }
}
```
